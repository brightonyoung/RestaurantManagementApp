This package contains both library and examples demonstrating the usage of the FireShot API:
Please make sure that you've placed these files on a real web site, because browsers usually do 
not allow running the scripts in local pages.

"fsapi.js"  - a script providing connectivity between a user web page and the FireShot functions.
"demo1.htm" - an example demonstrating how to detect, whether FireShot is available or not.
"demo2.htm" - an example demonstrating FireShot's API functions.
"demo3.htm" - live FireShot application.
